Even though I have few knowledge in the era of computer, there are three things I already know about ways that people steal my information from my computer. First, the people, especially crackers can steal my information by implanting virus in the download file. Above all, I must be most careful if I download files through torrent. By making my vaccine program work for all the times, I can prevent most of the problems.

If I release any of my personal information in the internet, not only hackers, but also common people can have a research on me. Since internet contains bunch of information about me, the people can easily steal my personal information. This is why I shouldn't tell the others my cellphone number, name, resident registration number, and so on in the games or sites. Obviously, I can prevent my information theft(?) in such way by telling none of my personal information.

Lastly, I shouldn't use free Wi-fi to prevent people stealing my information. I do not know specifically, but somehow as one uses Wi-fi, it gets way easier to get his IP address. For cracking with one's IP address is one of the easiest way to hack, I should not use private, unknown Wi-fi.
